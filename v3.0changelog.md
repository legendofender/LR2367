# LR2367
Lancer Robotics FRC Coding Test

Functionality: the entire algorithm of the previous version was thrown out because it was admittedly quite stupid to think that a right
wall follower would actually be able to solve the maze. The newest version is fully functional using the Tremaux algorithm (link here:
http://blog.jamisbuck.org/2014/05/12/tremauxs-algorithm.html) and can detect when it is in the end of the maze using an algorithm I
detailed in the file itself through its comments. V3.0 will most likely be the last version of the file to be uploaded to this GitHub repo.
