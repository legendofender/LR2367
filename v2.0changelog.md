# LR2367
Lancer Robotics FRC Coding Test

Functionality: added a check for when the mouse is in the endzone of the maze. The call is executed at the beginning of the call, since
moveForward() can only be called once per call of studentAI, and the check uses moveForward(). As such, the mouse must be in the endzone
at the beginning of the call to be able to recognize that it has reached the endzone.

Comments: Added numerous comments to the code which include describing the algorithm and also rewording lines of code from C++ to English.
Also includes the logic behind the algorithm.
